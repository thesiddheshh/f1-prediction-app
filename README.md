## Overview

Formula 1 is a multifaceted sport influenced by driver skill, car performance, team strategy, and environmental conditions. This project adopts a data science approach to race outcome forecasting by:

- Using **FastF1 telemetry and session data**
- Integrating **weather features** via API
- Training **machine learning models** for point and podium prediction
- Providing an **interactive Streamlit dashboard**

Ideal for:

- Data science students exploring ML in sports
- F1 fans simulating race outcomes
- Developers working with telemetry and real-time sports data

---

## Features

- **Telemetry Extraction**: Accesses lap times, sector data, and qualifying metrics via FastF1.
- **Weather Integration**: Adds real-time or historical weather data using the OpenWeather API.
- **Data Imputation**: Handles incomplete telemetry using intelligent fill strategies.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Uses Scikit-learn’s `GradientBoostingRegressor` for driver performance predictions.
- **Clean Air Pace**: Estimates true driver speed potential excluding traffic effects.
- **Podium Simulation**: Predicts likely podium finishers based on model results.
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Web app interface for data upload, predictions, and visualization.

## FAQ

**Q: Can this be used for live betting or gambling?**  
A: No. This tool is for academic, educational, and fan engagement purposes only.

**Q: Why aren't predictions always accurate?**  
A: F1 races are unpredictable. Models do not currently account for incidents like crashes, pit errors, or DNFs.

**Q: Is it optimized for sprint weekends?**  
A: Currently, it supports standard race weekends. Sprint formats may require manual handling.
